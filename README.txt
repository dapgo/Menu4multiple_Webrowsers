RECOMMENDATIONS (Better safer than sorry )

1 Do always a backup of your profile before opening it with a different browser than its default browser.
2 Do not share a profile with a not compatible browsers; or a lower version (i.e a FF56 profile with FF28)
3 Official browsers support, note that it is very likely that any problem you find (derived or not) to the profile, will not be consider under the official support.
4 Although it is not a best practise, if  you decide to open/move a profile with a higher browser version (ejm FFv52 with FFv56) 
	3.1 Do a backup/copy of original profile (v52).
	3.2 Disable all or most addons
	3.3 Open profile with higher version (v56)
	3.4 Enable add-ons individually and verify that they work and browser doesn't get unresponsive
	3.5 !!! Do not load the new and modified profile(v56) with the lower version (v52)
